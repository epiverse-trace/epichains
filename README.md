*epichains* is an R package to simulate, analyse, and visualize the size
and length of branching processes with a given offspring distribution.
These models are often used in infectious disease epidemiology, where
the chains represent chains of transmission, and the offspring
distribution represents the distribution of secondary infections caused
by an infected individual.

*epichains* re-implements
[bpmodels](%22https://github.com/epiverse-trace/bpmodels/%22) by
providing dedicated data structures that allow easy manipulation and
interoperability with other existing packages for handling transmission
chain and contact-tracing data.

*epichains* is developed at the [Centre for the Mathematical Modelling
of Infectious
Diseases](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases)
at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as part of the
[Epiverse Initiative](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/).

# Installation

The latest development version of the *epichains* package can be
installed via

``` r
# check whether {pak} is installed
if (!require("pak")) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("epiverse-trace/epichains")
```

To load the package, use

``` r
library("epichains")
```

# Quick start

## Core functionality

*epichains* provides four main functions:

### [likelihood()](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epichains/reference/likelihood.html)

This function calculates the likelihood/loglikelihood of observing a
vector of outbreak summaries obtained from transmission chains.
Summaries here refer to transmission chain sizes or lengths/durations.

`likelihood()` requires a vector of chain summaries (sizes or lengths),
`chains`, the corresponding statistic to calculate, `statistic`, and the
offspring distribution, `offspring_dist` its associated parameters. It
also requires `nsim_obs`, which is the number of simulations to run if
the likelihoods do not have a closed-form solution and must be
simulated. This argument will be explained further in the [“Getting
Started”](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epichains/articles/epichains.html)
vignette.

Let’s look at the following example where we estimate the loglikelihood
of observing `chain_sizes`.

``` r
set.seed(121)
# example of observed chain sizes
# randomly generate 20 chains of size between 1 to 10
chain_sizes <- sample(1:10, 20, replace = TRUE)
```

``` r
# estimate loglikelihood of the observed chain sizes
likelihood_eg <- likelihood(
  chains = chain_sizes,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = "pois",
  nsim_obs = 100,
  lambda = 0.5
)
# Print the estimate
likelihood_eg
#> [1] -67.82879
```

### [simulate_tree()](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epichains/reference/simulate_tree.html)

`simulate_tree()` simulates an outbreak from a given number of
infections. It retains and returns information on infectors (ancestors),
infectees, the generation of infection, and the time, if a serial
distribution is specified.

Let’s look at an example where we simulate the transmission trees of
$10$ initial infections/chains. We assume a poisson offspring
distribution with mean, $\text{lambda} = 0.9$, and a serial interval of
$3$ days:

``` r
set.seed(123)

sim_tree_eg <- simulate_tree(
  nchains = 10,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = "pois",
  stat_max = 10,
  serials_dist = function(x) 3,
  lambda = 0.9
)

head(sim_tree_eg)
#> < tree head (from first known ancestor) >
#>    chain_id sim_id ancestor generation time
#> 11        2      2        1          2    3
#> 13        3      2        1          2    3
#> 14        4      2        1          2    3
#> 16        5      2        1          2    3
#> 19        7      2        1          2    3
#> 20        8      2        1          2    3
```

`simulate_tree()` can model population-level intervention by reducing
the $R_0$, using the `intvn_mean_reduction` argument.

To illustrate this, we will use the previous example and specify a
population-level intervention that reduces $R_0$ by $50\%$.

``` r
set.seed(123)

sim_tree_intvn_eg <- simulate_tree(
  nchains = 10,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = "pois",
  intvn_mean_reduction = 0.5,
  stat_max = 10,
  serials_dist = function(x) 3,
  lambda = 0.9
)

head(sim_tree_intvn_eg)
#> < tree head (from first known ancestor) >
#>    chain_id sim_id ancestor generation time
#> 11        2      2        1          2    3
#> 12        4      2        1          2    3
#> 13        5      2        1          2    3
#> 15        8      2        1          2    3
#> 14        5      3        1          2    3
#> 16        2      3        2          3    6
```

### [simulate_summary()](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epichains/reference/simulate_summary.html)

`simulate_summary()` is basically `simulate_tree()` except that it does
not retain information on each infector and infectee. It returns the
eventual size or length/duration of each transmission chain.

Here is an example to simulate the previous examples without
intervention, returning the size of each of the $10$ chains. It assumes
a poisson offspring distribution with mean of $0.9$.

``` r
set.seed(123)

simulate_summary_eg <- simulate_summary(
  nchains = 10,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = "pois",
  stat_max = 10,
  lambda = 0.9
)

# Print the results
simulate_summary_eg
#> `epichains` object 
#> 
#>  [1]   1 Inf   4   4 Inf   1   2 Inf   5   3
#> 
#>  Simulated chain sizes: 
#> 
#> Max: 5
#> Min: 1
```

Here is an example with an intervention that reduces $R_0$ by $50\%$.

``` r
simulate_summary_intvn_eg <- simulate_summary(
  nchains = 10,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = "pois",
  intvn_mean_reduction = 0.5,
  stat_max = 10,
  lambda = 0.9
)

# Print the results
simulate_summary_intvn_eg
#> `epichains` object 
#> 
#>  [1] 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 1
#> 
#>  Simulated chain sizes: 
#> 
#> Max: 2
#> Min: 1
```

### [simulate_tree_from_pop()](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epichains/reference/simulate_tree_from_pop.html)

`simulate_tree_from_pop()` simulates outbreaks based on a specified
population size and pre-existing immunity until the susceptible pool
runs out.

Here is a quick example where we simulate an outbreak in a population of
size $1000$. We assume individuals have a poisson offspring distribution
with mean, $\text{lambda} = 1$, and serial interval of $3$:

``` r
set.seed(7)

sim_tree_from_pop_eg <- simulate_tree_from_pop(
  pop = 1000,
  offspring_dist = "pois",
  lambda = 1,
  serials_dist = function(x) {3}
  )

head(sim_tree_from_pop_eg)
#> < tree head (from first known ancestor) >
#>   sim_id ancestor generation time
#> 2      2        1          2    3
#> 3      3        1          2    3
#> 4      4        1          2    3
#> 5      5        1          2    3
#> 6      6        2          3    6
#> 7      7        6          4    9
```

## Other functionalities

### Summarising

You can run `summary()` on `<epichains>` objects to get useful
summaries.

``` r
# Example with simulate_tree()
set.seed(123)

sim_tree_eg <- simulate_tree(
  nchains = 10,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = "pois",
  stat_max = 10,
  serials_dist = function(x) 3,
  lambda = 0.9
)

summary(sim_tree_eg)
#> $chains_run
#> [1] 10
#> 
#> $max_time
#> [1] 12
#> 
#> $unique_ancestors
#> [1] 9
#> 
#> $max_generation
#> [1] 5

# Example with simulate_summary()
set.seed(123)

simulate_summary_eg <- simulate_summary(
  nchains = 10,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = "pois",
  stat_max = 10,
  lambda = 0.9
)

# Get summaries
summary(simulate_summary_eg)
#> $chains_run
#> [1] 10
#> 
#> $max_chain_stat
#> [1] 5
#> 
#> $min_chain_stat
#> [1] 1
```

### Aggregating

You can aggregate `<epichains>` objects returned by the `simulate_*()`
functions into a time series, which is a `<data.frame>` with columns
“cases” and either “generation” or “time”, depending on the value of
`grouping_var`.

To aggregate over “time”, you must have specified a serial interval
distribution in the simulation step.

``` r
# Example with simulate_tree()
set.seed(123)

sim_tree_eg <- simulate_tree(
  nchains = 10,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = "pois",
  stat_max = 10,
  serials_dist = function(x) 3,
  lambda = 0.9
)

aggregate(sim_tree_eg, grouping_var = "time")
#>   time cases
#> 1    0    10
#> 2    3    13
#> 3    6    15
#> 4    9    18
#> 5   12     2
```

### Plotting

Aggregated `<epichains>` objects can easily be plotted using base R or
`ggplot2` with little to no data manipulation.

Here is an end-to-end example from simulation through aggregation to
plotting.

``` r
# Run simulation with simulate_tree()
set.seed(123)

sim_tree_eg <- simulate_tree(
  nchains = 10,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = "pois",
  stat_max = 10,
  serials_dist = function(x) 3,
  lambda = 0.9
)

# Aggregate cases over time
sim_aggreg <- aggregate(sim_tree_eg, grouping_var = "time")

# Plot cases over time
plot(sim_aggreg, type = "b")
```
