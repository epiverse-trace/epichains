# Assert if constructed random number generator for offspring exists and has an `n` argument.

Assert if constructed random number generator for offspring exists and
has an `n` argument.

## Usage

``` r
.assert_offspring_func_valid(offspring_dist)
```

## Arguments

- offspring_dist:

  Offspring distribution: a `<function>` like the ones provided by R to
  generate random numbers from given distributions (e.g.,
  [`rpois`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Poisson.html) for Poisson). More
  specifically, the function needs to accept at least one argument, `n`,
  which is the number of random numbers to generate. It can accept
  further arguments, which will be passed on to the random number
  generating functions. Examples that can be provided here are `rpois`
  for Poisson distributed offspring, `rnbinom` for negative binomial
  offspring, or custom functions.
