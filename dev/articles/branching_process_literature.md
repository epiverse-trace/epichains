# Literature on branching process applications

Below, we provide a bibliography on the application of branching
processes to infectious disease modelling.

It is our intention to grow this list to serve as a point of reference
for budding modellers with an interest in the subject.

If you would like to extend this list, the easiest way would be to [file
an
issue](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epichains/issues/new/choose),
listing the new additions and we’ll take it from there, or [submit a
pull request](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epichains/pulls) with an
updated version of the bibliography file found in
“vignettes/branching_process_literature.json”.
