```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

_{{ packagename }}_ is an R package to simulate, analyse, and visualize the size 
and length of branching processes with a given offspring distribution. These 
models are often used in infectious disease epidemiology, where the chains represent chains of
transmission, and the offspring distribution represents the distribution of 
secondary infections caused by an infected individual. 

_{{ packagename }}_ re-implements [bpmodels]("https://github.com/epiverse-trace/bpmodels/")
by providing dedicated data structures that allow easy manipulation and interoperability with other existing
packages for handling transmission chain and contact-tracing data.

_{{ packagename }}_ is developed at the [Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases) at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as part of the [Epiverse Initiative](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/).

# Installation

The latest development version of the _{{ packagename }}_ package can be installed via

```{r include=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# check whether {pak} is installed
if (!require("pak")) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("{{ gh_repo }}")
```

To load the package, use

```{r eval=TRUE}
library("epichains")
```

# Quick start

## Core functionality

_{{ packagename }}_ provides four main functions: 

### [likelihood()](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epichains/reference/likelihood.html)

This function calculates the likelihood/loglikelihood of observing a vector of outbreak summaries obtained from transmission chains. Summaries here refer to transmission chain sizes or lengths/durations.

`likelihood()` requires a vector of chain summaries (sizes or lengths),
`chains`, the corresponding statistic to calculate, `statistic`, and the offspring distribution,
`offspring_dist` its associated parameters. It also requires `nsim_obs`, which is the number of simulations to run if the likelihoods do not have a closed-form solution and must be simulated. This argument will be explained further in the ["Getting Started"](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epichains/articles/epichains.html) vignette.

Let's look at the following example where we estimate the loglikelihood of observing `chain_sizes`.
```{r}
set.seed(121)
# example of observed chain sizes
# randomly generate 20 chains of size between 1 to 10
chain_sizes <- sample(1:10, 20, replace = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# estimate loglikelihood of the observed chain sizes
likelihood_eg <- likelihood(
  chains = chain_sizes,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = "pois",
  nsim_obs = 100,
  lambda = 0.5
)
# Print the estimate
likelihood_eg
```


### [simulate_tree()](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epichains/reference/simulate_tree.html) 

`simulate_tree()` simulates an outbreak from a given number of infections.
It retains and returns information on infectors (ancestors), infectees, the generation of infection, and the time, if a serial distribution is specified.

Let's look at an example where we simulate the transmission trees of $10$ initial infections/chains. We 
assume a poisson offspring distribution with mean, $\text{lambda} = 0.9$, and a serial interval of $3$ days:
```{r}
set.seed(123)

sim_tree_eg <- simulate_tree(
  nchains = 10,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = "pois",
  stat_max = 10,
  serials_dist = function(x) 3,
  lambda = 0.9
)

head(sim_tree_eg)
```

`simulate_tree()` can model population-level intervention by reducing the $R_0$,
using the `intvn_mean_reduction` argument.

To illustrate this, we will use the previous example and specify
a population-level intervention that reduces $R_0$ by $50\%$.

```{r}
set.seed(123)

sim_tree_intvn_eg <- simulate_tree(
  nchains = 10,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = "pois",
  intvn_mean_reduction = 0.5,
  stat_max = 10,
  serials_dist = function(x) 3,
  lambda = 0.9
)

head(sim_tree_intvn_eg)
```

### [simulate_summary()](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epichains/reference/simulate_summary.html)

`simulate_summary()` is basically `simulate_tree()` except that it does not retain
information on each infector and infectee. It returns the eventual size or length/duration of each transmission chain.

Here is an example to simulate the previous examples without intervention,
returning the size of each of the $10$ chains. It assumes a poisson offspring distribution with
mean of $0.9$.
```{r}
set.seed(123)

simulate_summary_eg <- simulate_summary(
  nchains = 10,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = "pois",
  stat_max = 10,
  lambda = 0.9
)

# Print the results
simulate_summary_eg
```

Here is an example with an intervention that reduces $R_0$ by $50\%$.

```{r}
simulate_summary_intvn_eg <- simulate_summary(
  nchains = 10,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = "pois",
  intvn_mean_reduction = 0.5,
  stat_max = 10,
  lambda = 0.9
)

# Print the results
simulate_summary_intvn_eg
```


### [simulate_tree_from_pop()](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epichains/reference/simulate_tree_from_pop.html)

`simulate_tree_from_pop()` simulates outbreaks based on a specified population size and pre-existing immunity until the susceptible pool runs out.
  
Here is a quick example where we simulate an outbreak in a population of size $1000$. We assume individuals have a poisson offspring distribution with mean, $\text{lambda} = 1$, and serial interval of $3$:
```{r}
set.seed(7)

sim_tree_from_pop_eg <- simulate_tree_from_pop(
  pop = 1000,
  offspring_dist = "pois",
  lambda = 1,
  serials_dist = function(x) {3}
  )

head(sim_tree_from_pop_eg)
```

## Other functionalities

### Summarising

You can run `summary()` on `<epichains>` objects to get useful summaries.
```{r include=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
# Example with simulate_tree()
set.seed(123)

sim_tree_eg <- simulate_tree(
  nchains = 10,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = "pois",
  stat_max = 10,
  serials_dist = function(x) 3,
  lambda = 0.9
)

summary(sim_tree_eg)

# Example with simulate_summary()
set.seed(123)

simulate_summary_eg <- simulate_summary(
  nchains = 10,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = "pois",
  stat_max = 10,
  lambda = 0.9
)

# Get summaries
summary(simulate_summary_eg)
```

### Aggregating

You can aggregate `<epichains>` objects returned by the `simulate_*()` functions into a time series, which is a `<data.frame>` with columns "cases"  and either "generation" or "time", depending on the value of `grouping_var`.

To aggregate over "time", you must have specified a serial interval distribution in the simulation step.
```{r include=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
# Example with simulate_tree()
set.seed(123)

sim_tree_eg <- simulate_tree(
  nchains = 10,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = "pois",
  stat_max = 10,
  serials_dist = function(x) 3,
  lambda = 0.9
)

aggregate(sim_tree_eg, grouping_var = "time")
```

### Plotting

Aggregated `<epichains>` objects can easily be plotted using base R or `ggplot2` with little to no data manipulation.

Here is an end-to-end example from simulation through aggregation to plotting.
```{r}
# Run simulation with simulate_tree()
set.seed(123)

sim_tree_eg <- simulate_tree(
  nchains = 10,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = "pois",
  stat_max = 10,
  serials_dist = function(x) 3,
  lambda = 0.9
)

# Aggregate cases over time
sim_aggreg <- aggregate(sim_tree_eg, grouping_var = "time")

# Plot cases over time
plot(sim_aggreg, type = "b")
```
