_{{ packagename }}_ is an R package to simulate, analyse, and visualize the size 
and length of branching processes with a given offspring distribution. These 
models are often used in infectious disease epidemiology, where the chains represent chains of
transmission, and the offspring distribution represents the distribution of 
secondary infections caused by an infected individual. 

_{{ packagename }}_ re-implements [bpmodels]("https://github.com/epiverse-trace/bpmodels/") by providing dedicated data structures that allow easy manipulation and interoperability with other existing
packages for handling transmission chain and contact-tracing data.

_{{ packagename }}_ is developed at the [Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases) at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as part of the [Epiverse Initiative](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/).

# Installation

```

To load the package, use

```{r eval=TRUE}
library("epichains")
```
