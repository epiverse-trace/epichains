This vignette outlines the design decisions that have been taken during the
development of the `{epichains}` R package, and provides some of the reasoning,
and possible pros and cons of each decision.

The goal here is to make it easy to acquaint oneself with the code base
in the absence of the current maintainer. This will ease future contributions
and maintenance of the package.

## Scope

{epichains} aims to facilitate:

* Simulation of transmission chains using branching processes methods,
* Handling of transmission chains using objected-orientated design, and
* Estimation of the likelihood of observing transmission chain summaries
(sizes or lengths). This can be achieved in two ways:
  - Analytical/closed-form likelihoods that take the form
`<distribution>_<chain_statistic_type>_ll>`, for example, `gborel_size_ll()`
and `pois_length_ll()`.
  - Numerical likelihood simulation using `offspring_ll()`.

Additionally, the package provides mixture probability distributions for
generating offspring distributions, for example, `rborel()`.

## Input/Output/Interoperability

`simulate_chains()` and `simulate_summary()` return `<epichains>` and
`<epichains_summary>` objects respectively.

The transmission chain simulations simulated here are stochastic in nature,
meaning that one set of inputs can produce varied results. Additionally,
parameters are often varied in scenario analyses to explore the impact of
different parameter values on the outcome of the simulation.

In traditional modelling, the output of the simulation is often stored in a
`<data.frame>` or a list. However, this approach can be limiting when
performing scenario analyses, as the user has to manually store the input
parameters and the output of the simulation in a separate object. This has
the potential to lead to errors and loss of information. The `<epichains>`
class surmounts this limitation by storing the input parameters and the output
of the simulation in a single object.

The `<epichains>` class is an extension of `<data.frame>` with columns that
represent information about the transmission chains. It also stores the
simulation results and parameter values used to achieve the simulation.
`<data.frame>` was chosen because its tabular structure allows us to store
information in rows and columns, and is a widely used data structure in R.

The output of `simulate_chains()` contains information about the whole
outbreak, but this is not easy to infer from a quick glance of the object.
The `<epichains>` class, therefore, has a dedicated `format()/print()` to
print the simulated transmission chains in a manner similar to a dataframe
but accompanied by extra summary information about the simulation including
the number of chains simulated, number of generations reached, and the number
of unique infectors created. These summaries are useful for quickly assessing
the output of the simulation.

Importantly, the `<epichains>` class has a `summary()` method that returns
an `<epichains_summary>` object. This is a design decision that was taken to
allow for easy coercion between an infection tree and summaries of the
infection tree otherwise attainable by a separate run of `simulate_summary()`.

The `<epichains_summary>` class is a subclass of `<vector>` and has a
`print()` method that formats the output of the `summary()` method.

### `<epichains>` class

* Columns of `<epichains>`: 
  * `generation_time` (numeric)
  * `infector_id` (factor) 
  * `infectee_id` (factor) 
  * `generation` (integer)

* Objects of this class have attributes to store simulation
  parameters: `index_cases`, `statistic`,`stat_max`, `offspring_dist`,
  `generation_time`, and `pop`.

### likelihood estimation

Likelihoods are estimated using the `likelihood()` function. The
function is designed to be flexible in two inputs:

* data can be supplied as a vector of chain summaries, a `<epichains>` object,
or a `<epichains_summary>` object, and
* the offspring distribution can be supplied as a function, allowing the
user to use a custom offspring distributions.

`likelihood()` uses either analytical or numerical methods to estimate the
likelihood of observing the input chain summaries. The analytical methods are
closed-form likelihoods that take the form `<offspring_dist>_<statistic>_ll`,
for example, `gborel_size_ll()` and `pois_length_ll()` and are shipped in this
package. If the user supplies an offspring distribution and a statistic for
which a solution exists, internally, it is used. If not, simulations are used
to estimate the likelihood. The numerical likelihood simulation is achieved
using `offspring_ll()`, which is a wrapper around `simulate_summary()`.

The output type of `likelihood()` depends on the combination of the
arguments `individual`, `obs_prob`, and `nsim_obs` as summarised in the
table below:

| `individual` | `obs_prob` | Output type | Output length| Element length |
|--------------|------------|-------------|-------|----------------|
| `FALSE`      |  1         | `<numeric>` | 1     | NA             |
| `FALSE`      |  `obs_prob` >= 0 and `obs_prob` <= 1       | `<numeric>`|
`nsim_obs`     | NA              |
| `TRUE`       |  1         | `<list>`  | 1 | input data |
| `TRUE`       | `obs_prob` >= 0 and `obs_prob` <= 1     | `<list>` |
`nsim_obs` | input data |

## Dependencies

* Input validation:
  - [checkmate](https://github.com/mllg/checkmate/): exports many `test_*()`,
  `check_*()` and `assert_*()` functions and is available on CRAN.

## Development journey

{epichains} is a successor to the
[bpmodels](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/bpmodels) package,
which had the same functionality but not structured in an object-oriented
manner. {epichains} is a major refactoring of {bpmodels} to provide an
object-oriented approach to simulating and handling transmission chains in R.
