Infectious disease epidemics spread through populations when a chain of infected individuals transmit the
infection to others.
[Branching processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branching_process) can be used to model this process.
A branching process is a stochastic process where each infectious individual in a
generation gives rise to a random number of individuals in the next generation, starting with the index case in generation 1.
The distribution of the number of offspring is called the offspring
distribution.

The size of the transmission chain is the total number of
individuals infected by a single case, and the length of the transmission
chain is the number of generations from the first case to the last case they
produced before the chain ended. The size calculation includes the first case and the length calculation includes the first generation when the first case starts the chain (See figure below).

```{r out.width = "75%", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "An example of a transmission chain starting with a single case C1. Cases are represented by blue circles and arrows indicate who infected whom. The chain grows through generations Gen 1, Gen 2, and Gen 3, producing cases C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6. The chain ends at generation Gen 3 with cases C4, C5, and C6. The size of C1's chain is 6, including C1 (that is, the sum of all blue circles) and the length is 3, which includes Gen 1 (maximum number of generations reached by C1's chain).", fig.alt = "The figure shows an example of a transmission chain starting with a single case C1. The complete chain is depicted as blue circles linked by orange directed arrows showing the cases produced in each generation. Each generation is marked by a brown rectangle and labelled Gen 1, Gen 2, and Gen 3. The chain grows through generations Gen 1, Gen 2, and Gen 3. Case C1 starts in Gen 1 and produces cases C2, and C3 in Gen 2. In Gen 3, C2 produces C4 and C5, and C3 produces C6. The chain ends in Gen 3. The chain size of C1 is 6, which includes C1 (that is the sum of all the blue circles, representing cases) and the length is 3, which includes Gen 1 (maximum number of generations reached by C1's chain)."}

_epichains_ provides methods to analyse and simulate the size and length
of branching processes with an arbitrary offspring distribution. These
can be used, for example, to analyse the distribution of chain sizes
or length of infectious disease outbreaks, as discussed in @farrington2003 and 
@blumberg2013.

## Transmission chains likelihoods

::: {.alert .alert-primary}
### Use case {-}
Suppose we have observed a number of transmission chains, each arising from a separate index case. What are the likely transmission properties
(reproduction number and/or superspreading coefficient) that
generated these chains (assuming these parameters are the same across all the chains)?

The first step in answering this question is to calculate the likelihood of
observing the observed chain summaries given the transmission properties. This
is where the `likelihood()` function comes in. The returned estimate can then
be used to infer the transmission properties using estimation frameworks such
as maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference.

_epichains_ does not provide these estimation frameworks.
:::

::: {.alert .alert-secondary}
#### What we have {-}

1. Data on observed transmission chains summaries (sizes or lengths).

#### What we assume {-}

1. An offspring distribution that governs the number of secondary cases
produced by each case.
2. Parameters of the offspring distribution (for example, mean and overdispersion if using a negative binomial; which can then be interpreted as reproduction number and superspreading coefficient, respectively)
3. (optional) An observation process/probability that generates the observed chain
summaries.
4. (optional) A threshold of chain summaries that are considered too large to be consistent with a reproduction number of $R<1$ (e.g., $N$ cases or $T$ generations in total).
:::

### [`likelihood()`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epichains/reference/likelihood.html)

This function calculates the likelihood/loglikelihood of observing a vector of
outbreak summaries obtained from transmission chains. "Outbreak summaries" here
refer to transmission chain sizes or lengths/durations.

`likelihood()` requires a vector of chain summaries (sizes or lengths),
`chains`, the corresponding statistic to use, `statistic`, the offspring
distribution, `offspring_dist` and its associated parameters.

`offspring_dist` is specified by the R function that is used to generate random
numbers, i.e. `rpois` for Poisson, `rnbinom` for negative binomial, or a custom
function.

By default, the result is a log-likelihood but if `log = FALSE`, then
likelihoods are returned (See `?likelihood` for more details).

::: {.alert .alert-info}
To understand how `likelihood()` works see the section on [How `likelihood()` works](#how-likelihood-works).
:::

Let's look at the following example where we estimate the log-likelihood of
observing `chain_sizes`.
```{r estimate_likelihoods}
set.seed(121)
# example of observed chain sizes
# randomly generate 20 chains of size between 1 to 10
chain_sizes <- sample(1:10, 20, replace = TRUE)
chain_sizes
# estimate loglikelihood of the observed chain sizes for given lambda
likelihood_eg <- likelihood(
  chains = chain_sizes,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = rpois,
  nsim_obs = 100,
  lambda = 0.5
)
# Print the estimate
likelihood_eg
```

### Joint and individual log-likelihoods

`likelihood()`, by default, returns the joint log-likelihood, given by the sum of log-likelihoods of each observed chain. If instead
the individual log-likelihoods are desired (for example for calculating [Watanabe–Akaike information criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watanabe%E2%80%93Akaike_information_criterion) values, then the `individual` argument
must be set to `TRUE`. To return likelihoods instead, set `log = FALSE`.
```{r estimate_likelihoods2}
set.seed(121)
# example of observed chain sizes
# randomly generate 20 chains of size between 1 to 10
chain_sizes <- sample(1:10, 20, replace = TRUE)
chain_sizes

# estimate loglikelihood of the observed chain sizes
likelihood_ind_eg <- likelihood(
  chains = chain_sizes,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = rpois,
  nsim_obs = 100,
  lambda = 0.5,
  individual = TRUE
)
# Print the estimate
likelihood_ind_eg
```

### Observation probability

`likelihood()` uses the argument `obs_prob` to model the observation
probability.

By default, it assumes perfect observation, where `obs_prob = 1`
(See `?likelihood`), meaning that all transmission events are observed and
recorded in the data.

If observations are imperfect, the `obs_prob` must be
less than 1. In the case of imperfect observation, "true" chain sizes
or lengths are simulated `nsim_obs` times, and the likelihood calculated for
each of the simulations.

For example, if the probability of observing each case is `obs_prob = 0.30`,
we use

```{r likelihoods_imperfect_obs}
set.seed(121)
# example of observed chain sizes; randomly generate 20 chains of size 1 to 10
chain_sizes <- sample(1:10, 20, replace = TRUE)
# get their likelihood
liks <- likelihood(
  chains = chain_sizes,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = rpois,
  obs_prob = 0.3,
  lambda = 0.5,
  nsim_obs = 10
)
liks
```

This returns `10` likelihood values (because `nsim_obs = 10`), which can be
averaged to come up with an overall likelihood estimate.

### How `likelihood()` works {#how-likelihood-works}

`likelihood()` first checks if an analytical solution of the likelihood exists
for the given offspring distribution and chain statistic specified. If there's
none, simulations are used to estimate the likelihoods.

The _epichains_ package includes closed-form (analytical) solutions for
calculating the likelihoods associated with certain summaries of transmission
chains ("size" or "length") for specific offspring distributions.

For the size distributions, the package provides the Poisson, negative binomial,
and gamma-borel mixture.

::: {.alert .alert-info}
To provide the gamma-Borel size likelihood, the [Borel distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_distribution) is needed.
However, base R does not provide this distribution natively like poisson and
gamma, so _epichains_ provides its [density and random generator](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epichains/reference/index.html#special-distributions).
:::

For the length distribution, there's the Poisson and
geometric distributions. These can be used with `likelihood()` based on what is
specified for `offspring_dist` and `statistic`.

If an analytical solution does not exist, an internal simulation function,
`.offspring_ll()` is employed. It uses simulations to approximate the probability
distributions ([using a linear approximation to the cumulative 
distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_distribution_function) 
for unobserved sizes/lengths). If simulation is to be used, an extra argument
`nsim_offspring`  must be passed to `likelihood()` to specify the number of
simulations to be used for this approximation.
Approximate values of the likelihood will vary with every call to the simulation (because the simulations used for estimation vary), and it may be worth calling `likelihood()` multiple times in this case to see the error this may introduce.

For example, let's look at an example where `chain_sizes` is observed and we
want to calculate the likelihood of this being drawn from a binomial
distribution with probability `prob = 0.9`.
```{r likelihoods_by_simulation}
set.seed(121)
# example of observed chain sizes; randomly generate 20 chains of size 1 to 10
chain_sizes <- sample(1:10, 20, replace = TRUE)
# get their likelihood
liks <- likelihood(
  chains = chain_sizes,
  offspring_dist = rbinom,
  statistic = "size",
  size = 1,
  prob = 0.9,
  nsim_offspring = 250
)
liks
```

## Transmission chain simulation

::: {.alert .alert-primary}
### Use case {-}
We want to simulate a scenario where a number of chains are each
produced by a separate index case. We want to simulate the chains of
transmission that result from these cases, given a specific offspring
distribution and a reproduction number.
:::

::: {.alert .alert-secondary}
#### What we have {-}

1. An initial number of cases that seed the outbreak.

#### What we assume {-}

1. An offspring distribution that governs the number of secondary cases produced by each case.
2. Parameters of the offspring distribution (for example, mean and overdispersion if using a negative binomial; which can then be interpreted as reproduction number and superspreading coefficient, respectively)
3. (optional) A threshold of chain summaries that are considered too large to be consistent with a reproduction number of $R<1$ (e.g., $N$ cases or $T$ generations in total).
4. (optional) A generation time distribution that governs the time between successive cases.
:::

There are two simulation functions, herein referred to collectively as the
`simulate_*()` functions that can help us achieve this.

### [`simulate_chains()`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epichains/reference/simulate_chains.html) 

`simulate_chains()` simulates an outbreak from a given number of infections and
an offspring distribution. By default, it assumes the population is infinite
with no pre-existing immunity.

The function tracks and returns information on infectors (ancestors),
infectees, the generation of infection, and the time, if a generation time
function is specified.

Let's look at an example where we simulate a transmission tree for $10$ index
cases. We assume a poisson offspring distribution with mean,
$\text{lambda} = 0.9$, and a generation time of $3$ days:
```{r sim_chains_pois}
set.seed(32)
# Define generation time
generation_time_fn <- function(n) {
  gt <- rep(3, n)
  return(gt)
}

sim_chains <- simulate_chains(
  n_chains = 10,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = rpois,
  stat_threshold = 10,
  generation_time = generation_time_fn,
  lambda = 0.9
)

head(sim_chains)
```

::: {.alert .alert-info}
By default, `simulate_chains()` assumes an infinite population but can account for susceptible depletion when a finite `pop` is specified. 

Pre-existing immunity levels can also be specified, which will be applied to `pop` before the simulation is initialised.
:::

Here is a quick example where we simulate an outbreak in a population of
size $1000$ with $10$ index cases and $10/%$ pre-existing immunity. We assume
individuals have a poisson offspring distribution with mean,
$\text{lambda} = 1$, and fixed generation time of $3$:
```{r sim_chains_with_finite_pop}
set.seed(32)
# Define generation time
generation_time_fn <- function(n) {
  gt <- rep(3, n)
  return(gt)
}

sim_chains_with_pop <- simulate_chains(
  pop = 1000,
  n_chains = 10,
  percent_immune = 0.1,
  offspring_dist = rpois,
  statistic = "size",
  lambda = 1,
  generation_time = generation_time_fn
)

head(sim_chains_with_pop)
```


### [`simulate_chain_stats()`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epichains/reference/simulate_chain_stats.html)

::: {.alert .alert-primary}
`simulate_chain_stats()` is a performant version of `simulate_chains()` that
does not track information on each infector and infectee. It returns the
eventual size or length/duration of each transmission chain. This function is
especially useful for calculating numerical likelihoods in `likelihood()`.
:::

Here is an example to simulate the previous examples without intervention,
returning the size of each of the $10$ chains. It assumes a Poisson offspring distribution
distribution with mean of $0.9$.
```{r sim_summary_pois}
set.seed(123)

simulate_chain_stats_eg <- simulate_chain_stats(
  n_chains = 10,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = rpois,
  stat_threshold = 10,
  lambda = 0.9
)

# Print the results
simulate_chain_stats_eg
```

## S3 Methods

### Summarising

You can run `summary()` on the object returned by `simulate_chains()` to
obtain the chain summaries per index case.
```{r summary_eg, include=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
set.seed(32)
# Define generation time
generation_time_fn <- function(n) {
  gt <- rep(3, n)
  return(gt)
}

sim_chains <- simulate_chains(
  n_chains = 10,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = rpois,
  stat_threshold = 10,
  generation_time = generation_time_fn,
  lambda = 0.9
)

summary(sim_chains)

# Example with simulate_chain_stats()
set.seed(32)

simulate_chain_stats_eg <- simulate_chain_stats(
  n_chains = 10,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = rpois,
  stat_threshold = 10,
  lambda = 0.9
)

# Get summaries
summary(simulate_chain_stats_eg)
```

This summary is the same as the output of `simulate_chain_stats()` if the same
inputs are used. `simulate_chain_stats()` is a more performant version of
`simulate_chains()`, hence, you can use it instead, if you are only interested
in the summary of the simulated chains without details about the infection
tree.
:::

We can confirm if the two outputs are the same using `base::setequal()`, which
checks if two objects are equal and returns `TRUE/FALSE`.

```{r compare_sim_funcs, include=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
setequal(
  # summary of output from simulate_chains()
  summary(sim_chains),
  # results from simulate_chain_stats()
  simulate_chain_stats_eg
)
```

### Aggregating

You can aggregate `<epichains_tree>` objects returned by `simulate_chains()`
a `<data.frame>` with columns "cases" and either "generation" or "time",
depending on the value of `by`.

To aggregate over "time", you must have specified a generation time
distribution (`generation_time`) in the simulation step.
```{r aggregation_eg, include=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
# Example with simulate_chains()
set.seed(32)

# Define generation time
generation_time_fn <- function(n) {
  gt <- rep(3, n)
  return(gt)
}

sim_chains <- simulate_chains(
  n_chains = 10,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = rpois,
  stat_threshold = 10,
  generation_time = generation_time_fn,
  lambda = 0.9
)

aggregate(sim_chains, by = "time")
```

### Plotting

We can plot individual chains in an `<epichains>` object using the
[{epicontacts} package](https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/epicontacts/).

To do this, we first need to create an `<epicontacts>` object using the
`epicontacts::make_epicontacts()` function, which requires a linelist and a
contacts data.frame (See `?epicontacts::make_epicontacts()`).

::: {.alert .alert-info}

### Some notes about interoperability between `<epicontacts>` and `<epichains>` objects

- For the `epicontacts::make_epicontacts()` function to work:
  - the `linelist` and `contacts` data.frames must have a column named "id" that
  uniquely identifies each case.
  - The `linelist` and `contacts` objects can be the same.

- An `<epichains>` object contains multiple independent chains with their own
unique infectee ids, so this does not work out of the box with
`make_epicontacts()` unless you use a subset chain.

- For now, we will have to select and visualise individual chains from the
`<epichains>` object.

- In future versions of this package, we will make this interaction seamless
by providing user-friendly functionality to convert an `<epichains>` object to
an `<epicontacts>` in a way that allows us to plot all chains at once.

:::

Let's plot one of the chains with the biggest size from the `sim_chains` object
created above.

```{r plot_epc}
library(epicontacts)
# Get the biggest chain
longest_chain <- sim_chains[sim_chains$chain == which.max(
  unname(table(sim_chains$chain))
), ]

# Create an `<epicontacts>` object
epc <- make_epicontacts(
  linelist = longest_chain,
  contacts = longest_chain,
  id = "infectee",
  from = "infectee",
  to = "infector"
)

# Plot the chain
plot(epc)
```

Aggregated `<epichains_tree>` objects can also be plotted using base R
or `ggplot2` with little to no data manipulation.

Here is an end-to-end example from simulation through aggregation to plotting.
```{r plot_eg}
# Run simulation with simulate_chains()
set.seed(32)
# Define generation time
generation_time_fn <- function(n) {
  gt <- rep(3, n)
  return(gt)
}

sim_chains <- simulate_chains(
  n_chains = 10,
  statistic = "size",
  offspring_dist = rpois,
  stat_threshold = 1000,
  generation_time = generation_time_fn,
  lambda = 2
)

# Aggregate cases over time
sim_chains_aggreg <- aggregate(sim_chains, by = "time")

# Plot cases over time
plot(
  sim_chains_aggreg,
  type = "b",
  col = "red",
  lwd = 2,
  xlab = "Time",
  ylab = "Cases"
)
```
