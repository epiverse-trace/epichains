# Outline

* Question: At what generation does an outbreak reach a size of 100, given that
  it was started by a single individual with R0 = 1.5, and individual
  transmission, $k$, at levels of 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 4, and Infinity?
* Method: 
  * We use a negative binomial model with $mu = 1.5$ and
  $size = c(0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 4, Inf)$.
  * We run 10, 000 simulations per each combination of $mu$ and $size$
  * We aggregate chain sizes by generation and extract the generation
    where cumulative chain size = 100.
  * We find the percentage of simulations that reached the 100 case size
    threshold.
* Outcome: The distribution (boxplot) of the realized generations per value of
  $k$. This reproduces Fig 2c of @lloyd-smith2005.
