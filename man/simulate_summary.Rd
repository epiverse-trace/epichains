\title{Simulate a vector of transmission chains sizes/lengths}
\usage{
simulate_summary(
  index_cases,
  statistic = c("size", "length"),
  offspring_dist,
  ...,
  stat_max = Inf,
  pop = Inf,
  percent_immune = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{index_cases}{Number of index cases to simulate transmission chains for.}

\item{statistic}{\verb{<String>}; Chain statistic to track as the stopping
criteria for each chain being simulated when \code{stat_max} is not \code{Inf}.
Can be one of:
\itemize{
\item "size": the total number of cases produced by a chain before it goes
extinct.
\item "length": the total number of ancestors produced by a chain before
it goes extinct.
}}

\item{offspring_dist}{Offspring distribution: a \verb{<character>} string
corresponding to the R distribution function (e.g., "pois" for Poisson,
where \code{\link{rpois}} is the R function to generate Poisson random
numbers).}

\item{...}{Parameters of the offspring distribution as required by R.}

\item{stat_max}{A cut off for the chain statistic (size/length) being
computed. Results above the specified value, are set to \code{Inf}.}

\item{pop}{\verb{<Integer>}; Population size. Used alongside \code{percent_immune}. to
define the susceptible population. Defaults to \code{Inf}.}

\item{percent_immune}{\verb{<numeric>}; Percent of the population immune to
infection at the start of the simulation. Used alongside \code{pop} to initialise
the susceptible population. Accepted values lie between 0 and 1.
Defaults to 0.}
}
\value{
a vector of chain sizes or lengths (of class \verb{<epichains_summary>})
with a value for each index case.
}
\description{
Generates a vector of transmission chain sizes and lengths with a
value for each index case. It uses a simple branching process model that
accepts an index number of cases that seed the outbreak, a distribution
of offspring per case, and a chain size or length/duration (statistic)
to track. It optionally accepts other population related inputs
such as the population size (defaults to Inf) and percentage of the
population initially immune (defaults to 0).

\section{\code{simulate_summary()} vs \code{simulate_chains()}}{
\code{simulate_summary()} is a time-invariant version of \code{simulate_chains()}. In
particular, it does not track the details of individual transmission events
but deals with eventual chain statistics, that is, the statistic
realised by a chain after dying out.

It is useful for generating a vector of chain sizes or lengths for a given
number of index cases, if details of who infected whom and the timing of
infection are not of interest.

This function is used in \code{{epichains}} for calculating likelihoods in
the \code{likelihood()} function and for sampling from the borel
distribution (See ?epichains::rborel). It is used extensively in the
vignette on
\href{https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epichains/articles/interventions.html}{modelling disease control},
where only data on observed chain sizes and lengths are available.
}

\section{Calculating chain sizes and lengths}{
The function simulates the chain size for individual \eqn{i} at time
\eqn{t}, \eqn{I_{t, i}}, as:
\deqn{I_{t, i} = \sum_{i}^{I_{t-1}}X_{t, i},}
and the chain length/duration for individual \eqn{i} at time \eqn{t},
\eqn{L_{t, i}}, as:
\deqn{L_{t, i} = {\sf min}(1, X_{t, i}), }
where \eqn{X_{t, i}} is the secondary cases generated by individual \eqn{i}
at time \eqn{t}, and \eqn{I_{0, i} = L_{0, i} = 1}.

The distribution of secondary cases, \eqn{X_{t, i}} is modelled by the
offspring distribution (\code{offspring_dist}).
\subsection{Specifying \code{generation_time}}{

The argument \code{generation_time} must be specified as a function with
one argument, \code{n}.

For example, assuming we want to specify the generation time as a random
log-normally distributed variable with \code{meanlog = 0.58} and \code{sdlog = 1.58},
we could define a named function, let's call it "generation_time_fn",
with only one argument representing the number of generation times to
sample: \code{generation_time_fn <- function(n){rlnorm(n, 0.58, 1.38)}},
and assign the name of the function to \code{generation_time} in
the simulation function, i.e.
\code{`simulate_*`(..., generation_time = generation_time_fn)},
where \code{...} are the other arguments to \verb{simulate_*()} and * is a placeholder
for the rest of simulation function's name.

Alternatively, we could assign an anonymous function to \code{generation_time}
in the \verb{simulate_*()} call, i.e.
\code{simulate_*(..., generation_time = function(n){rlnorm(n, 0.58, 1.38)})}
OR \code{simulate_*(..., generation_time = \(n){rlnorm(n, 0.58, 1.38)})},
where \code{...} are the other arguments to \verb{simulate_*()}.
